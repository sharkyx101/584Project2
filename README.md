# 584Project2
Michael Sanati's Project 2 for 584: This project utilizes a Flask backend to create a REST API endpoint for processing audio file uploads, with responses stored locally in a React frontend state. The Flask server is complemented by the CORS middleware, and the frontend employs React for dynamic UI updates, axios for API communication, and SheetJS for exporting data to Microsoft Excel format.
